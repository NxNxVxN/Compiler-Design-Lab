# Compiler Design Programs

This repository contains my Lex programs and C implementations for Compiler Design lab assignments and coursework. The programs demonstrate various lexical analysis and parsing techniques learned throughout the course.

## Lab Programs

These programs were developed during lab sessions to practice different aspects of lexical analysis and parsing.

| Program | Description | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Program1.l   | Lexical analyzer for valid identifier recognition | [Lab-Programs/Program1.l](Lab-Programs/Program1.l) |
| Program2.l   | C keyword recognition using Lex | [Lab-Programs/Program2.l](Lab-Programs/Program2.l) |
| Program3.l   | Operator classification (arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment) | [Lab-Programs/Program3.l](Lab-Programs/Program3.l) |
| Program4.l   | Comprehensive lexical analysis for C tokens (constants, comments, identifiers, operators) | [Lab-Programs/Program4.l](Lab-Programs/Program4.l) |
| Program5.l   | Vowel and consonant identification | [Lab-Programs/Program5.l](Lab-Programs/Program5.l) |
| Program6.l   | Function and comment detection in C code | [Lab-Programs/Program6.l](Lab-Programs/Program6.l) |
| Program7.c   | Top-down parsing implementation using backtracking method | [Lab-Programs/Program7.c](Lab-Programs/Program7.c) |

## Assignment Programs

Additional programs completed for course assignments, focusing on more advanced lexical analysis concepts.

| Program | Description | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Program1.l   | Enhanced identifier recognition with comprehensive pattern matching | [Assignment-Programs/Program1.l](Assignment-Programs/Program1.l) |
| Program2.l   | Real number recognition supporting various programming language representations | [Assignment-Programs/Program2.l](Assignment-Programs/Program2.l) |
